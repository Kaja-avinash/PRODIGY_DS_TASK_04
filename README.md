# 📈 DataVista: Exploratory Data Analysis on Real-World Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on executing a complete data analysis workflow — beginning with raw data cleaning and preprocessing, progressing through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and concluding with insightful visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships hidden within the dataset and communicate findings effectively.

---

## 🧠 Objective
- Perform **data cleaning** to handle missing, inconsistent, or noisy data.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to explore distributions and variable relationships.
- Apply **descriptive statistics and visualization** techniques to derive insights.
- Present findings in a structured and visually informative manner.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- The dataset represents real-world data with multiple numerical and categorical features.
- Ideal for practicing and demonstrating data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization skills.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and transformation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – plotting and visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis and documentation  

---

## 📊 Key Activities
- Detected and handled missing or erroneous data entries.
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Visualized key trends using histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, and box plots.
- Interpreted the correlation between features and highlighted interesting patterns.

---

## 🔍 Knowledge Gained
- Mastery of the EDA process in Python using standard libraries.
- Improved ability to clean and understand real-world data structures.
- Experience with effective data visualization techniques.
- Deeper understanding of the data analysis life cycle and how it informs decision-making.
